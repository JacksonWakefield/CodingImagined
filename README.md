# PathFinding Visualizer

The purpose of this website is visuzlize several different pathfinding algorithms given a variety of different scenarios. View the website [here](http://ethankeystone.github.io).


# Quick Start Guide 
The purpose of this grid is to show the fastest path between the **start node**(orange) and **end node**(purple). The path can be found through any sequence of horizontal or vertical movements (no diagonal ones). Use the mouse to place wall, weights, a new start or end node to customize the pathfinding grid. Customize which algorithm will be used by using the dropdown. Then, click find path to visualize a path.

# Weights
Weights are nodes that have an extra price in order for the path to traverse them. By default, every node has a weight of one. By using the weight option under the **placement dropdown**, one can place weights. Click on a weight node to increase the weight of it even higher. Click **Toggle Weight Numbers** to show numbers for each of the nodes. If you want to quickly see how different algorithms deal with weights, click **Generate Weighted Maze** for a weighted maze to be automatically generated.

# Walls
Walls represents nodes that are completely untraversible. Place walls using the walls option on the **placement dropdown** optoins. Or if you want to see a cool randomly generated maze, click the **generate maze** button.
